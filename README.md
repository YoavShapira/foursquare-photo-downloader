foursquare-photo-downloader
===========================

This is a simple script to download your own Foursquare photos. Feel free to use it however you see fit, modify it, etc.

I wrote it as a little tool for myself, having lost photos from my camera, but knowing I had some of the best in Foursquare checkins.

TODO
----

* Use limit + offset to page through more than the first result set of photos,
* Parallelize photo processing (downloading + saving),
* Make more things (e.g. photo download destination, # of photos to do, etc.) configurable,
* Have a mode where you only get photos from checkins with a certain text content, e.g. a hashtag
